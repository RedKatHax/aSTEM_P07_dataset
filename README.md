# aSTEM P07 Dataset: Temporal Correlation & Causal Attribution (Synthetic)

## Overview
This repository contains **synthetic forensic datasets** designed for AI evaluation and reasoning exercises under the aSTEM framework.  
All data are **artificially generated** and **fully sanitized** — no personal or organizational data is present.

### Files
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `ios_uuid_lineage_storm_noisy_v2.csv` | Timestamped iOS daemon UUID lineage rotations (assetsd, ospredictiond, etc.) with injected noise, clock skew, and decoy clusters. |
| `win_sysvol_dfsr_log_noisy_v2.csv` | Windows DFSR/SYSVOL replication logs with confounders, benign background events, and maintenance windows. |
| `rf_trigger_sample_noisy_v2.json` | Simulated RF activity metadata (spikes, background noise, and null bursts). |

### Purpose
Used for **cross-platform forensic reasoning** tasks (Prompt P07).  
Agents analyze temporal overlaps, infer causal probability, and justify their reasoning in legally defensible language.

### Provenance & Integrity
- Generated by AI using procedural randomization and controlled noise injection.
- Reviewed and sanitized by human analyst.
- Contains no real-world network, credential, or device data.
